# keyboarding

This was originally meant to be a demo that would work with the Circuit Playground Express, but the serial stuff was too finicky to risk showing in class (with Macs and Windows laptops and who knows what serial driver issues).

So instead, this is just a simple p5.js sketch (that also happens to use p5play). It responds to three keypresses: B, D, and L.

## Files

This is based on a template repo that includes the following libraries in its `libraries` folder, instead of sourcing them from the internet:

* [p5 & p5.sound](https://p5js.org/download/)
* [p5play & planck](https://github.com/quinton-ashley/p5play)
